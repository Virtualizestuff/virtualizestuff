Hi, I'm Dave! Welcome to VirtualizeStuff, where I break down the world of cloud infrastructure, virtualization, and container orchestration into digestible content that actually makes sense.

When I'm not tinkering in my [homelab](/homelab/), I get to work with some amazing businesses through VirtualizeStuff, helping them navigate their infrastructure challenges. Whether it's designing Kubernetes deployments for on-premises datacenters, architecting multi-cloud solutions, or modernizing legacy virtualization environments, I love diving in and finding the right solution for each unique situation.

This site is my lab notebook, tutorial library, and passion project all rolled into one. Let's dive into some tech!
